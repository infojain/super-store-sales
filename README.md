# Super Store Sales

![image](https://github.com/infojain/super-store-sales/assets/143530568/e7e4d427-8815-46cf-9a71-a4e7ee55a3ce)


I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data for a retail superstore.  The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, top-selling products, and regional performance. It also includes key metrics like total sales, profit, and quantity sold. This dashboard can help business users make data-driven decisions about sales and marketing strategies.*

- I used Power Query to clean and transform the data before creating the visualizations.
- I created custom visuals to effectively communicate the insights from the data.
- The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to drill down into the data for more detail.
